Dear Future Students,

I very much enjoyed this class mainly because each of the projects you do are in important to the next project, 
making it seem like a very "progressive" course. To succeed in this course you must follow all directions thoroughly
and read, watch and understand how the program will function before beginning a project. Often times I would spend
at least an hour or two to understand how the program functions, and then lectures took about 45 minutes to an hour.
Take your time, but don't take too much time! Plan ahead and at least look at the assignment the first day so you can
plan ahead. Overall I very much enjoyed the class and it felt very straight forward(may be because I had previous
experience, but not entirely).
